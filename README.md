# Typer Racer

A Java application that is a typing game implemented using the Trie data structure.
This was an assignment for course CS1027B.

## Setup

1.  Create a new project and import into your favourite IDE (Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ, etc.)
2.  If there are build errors:
    a. Right-click the project: `Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries`
    b. Remove the missing jars and add jars from the workspace under `resources > jars`
    c. Check the `Source` tab and ensure under the source folder that `Native library location` points to the `dll` folder
    c. Under `Order and Export`, check off all the jars, and then apply and close
3.  Clean and build the project
4.  Run the project (or TypeRacer.java)
